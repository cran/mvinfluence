Description: Computes regression deletion diagnostics for multivariate linear models and provides some associated
	diagnostic plots.  The diagnostic measures include hat-values (leverages), generalized Cook's distance, and
	generalized squared 'studentized' residuals.  Several types of plots to detect influential observations are
	provided.
